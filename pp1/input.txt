When we find it from known relationship with other directly

measured physical quantities we deal with indirect measurement of

this quantity. No measurement made can be ever exact. The accuracy

(correctness) and precision (number of significant figures) of a meas-

urement are always limited by the degree of refinement of the appa-

ratus used, by the skill of the observer, and by the basic physics in the

experiment. In doing experiments we are trying to establish the best

values for certain quantities, or trying to validate a theory. We must

also give a range of possible true values based on our limited number

of measurements. Why should repeated measurements of a single

quantity give different values? Mistakes on the part of the experi-

menter are possible, but we do not include these in our discussion.

We use the synonymous terms uncertainty, error, or deviation to rep-

resent the variation in measured data. Two types of errors are possi-

ble. Systematic error is the result of a mis-calibrated device, or a

measuring technique which always makes the measured value larger

(or smaller) than the "true" value. An example would be using a steel

ruler at liquid nitrogen temperature to measure the length of a rod.

The ruler will contract at low temperatures and therefore overestimate

the true length. Careful design of an experiment will allow us to elim-

inate or to correct systematic errors.
